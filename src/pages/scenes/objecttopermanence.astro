		<h1>Object to Permanence</h1>
		<p>
		There's a place you go<br>
		Where they weigh your heart<br>
		List your shames<br>
		Throw you where you belong<br>
		With the rest of the God-knows-whats.<br><br>
		
		You'll recognise your own handwriting<br>
		Scratched into the windowsills<br>
		And there's light coming through<br>
		Steel bars like your mother's fingers<br>
		The last time you two played peek-a-boo.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		It took you months, but you eventually learned that stuff doesn't disappear just because it's out of sight; even if you can't see it, God will keep an eye on it; everything is all right where you left it; the shame, your loved ones, the seeds you hid in the dirt; surely they're all right there and certainly won't have sprouted and flowered and had their leaves eaten away at by caterpillars.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		In dreams, time can wait.<br>
		In dreams, her youthful face.<br>
		In dreams, you'll have managed to make it all make sense, and they've told you they're sorry, a hug and a good cry works better than a drink; because on a long enough timescale, to be seen is to be understood; and, in dreams, to be understood is to be loved.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		But dreams are a means to an end, that end is the waking life.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		You look around the familiar room.<br>
		Every butterfly you've ever seen is pinned to the walls.<br>
		Their wings thrum in unison, the sound of distant thunder, swallowing your sobs<br>
		As you flutter through the bars, your back towards the Moon.
